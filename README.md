This project is a simple todo-list project

## Motivation

This project was created to learn about javascript, jQueries, css animation and web development in general. This is my journey to learn web development.

## Built With

* [jQuery](https://jquery.com) - jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.
